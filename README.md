## OBJECTIVE :-
 
 Any tourist who had been to Mysuru must had went through all these issues,
 - 1. Fare,
 - 2. Regional eats & beverage, and
 - 3. Navigation.

So we BARCAMPEEZ came up with a _solution_ which _acts as a bridge_ between a **Tourist** and the **Surrounding**. By, **Surrounding** I mean everything happening around the tourist! 

                                                         _**Sounds CRAZY right!!!**_
  
  Our project is not lesser than the **technology assistants** we are using in the current world by _reputed companies_. The only difference is that we are **not reputed yet**!!
  
  _**SO GIVE A TRY !!! WE GIVE YOU SATISFACTION!!!**_

- 1. Accomodation
